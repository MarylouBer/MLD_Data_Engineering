# Project 6: Scuba Diving Weather Checker

This Python script fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API to assist divers in making informed decisions.
In the last line of code add your API key otherwise you will not be able to fetch data.

### Key Features:
- **City-Based Lookup**: Users provide a city to retrieve current weather.
- **Clear-Sky Logic**: If the sky is clear, the script recommends diving; otherwise, it prompts caution.
- **API Integration**: Uses the `requests` library to make and handle API calls.
- **Response Parsing**: Extracts and interprets relevant weather conditions from the JSON response.

Helpful for hobby use or as a foundation for more advanced weather-related applications.
