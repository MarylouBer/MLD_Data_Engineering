# MLD Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of projects I've built to practice and demonstrate my skills in data engineering. Each project focuses on a specific concept or technology relevant to the field, from web scraping and ETL pipelines to scripting and AWS integrations.

My goal with this portfolio is to apply theory to real-world use cases and continue developing hands-on experience across various tools and practices in the data engineering ecosystem.

Feel free to explore each project folder to see detailed documentation, source code, and key learning outcomes.
