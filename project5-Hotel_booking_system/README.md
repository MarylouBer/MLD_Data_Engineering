# Project 5: Hotel Room Booking System

This Python beginner project simulates a simple hotel room booking tool for a five-room hotel (operational until 2026).

### Features:
- **Check Room Availability**: Validates if a room is available on a specific date.
- **Manage Reservations**: Adds and tracks reservations using a dictionary-based system.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures correctness of room numbers and date entries.
- **Date Handling**: Utilizes `datetime` for robust date management.
- **User Interaction**: Loops and exception handling support user-friendly error messages.

Great exercise for building user-facing tools and working with data structures.
