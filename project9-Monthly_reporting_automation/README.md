# Monthly Reporting Automation Workflow

This project automates the process of preparing and distributing monthly reports using Google Colab, Excel, and email. 
It streamlines a previously manual workflow by cleaning and formatting data, applying conditional styling, saving the output, and notifying stakeholders via email.

# What It Does

- Uploads an Excel source file
- Cleans, filters, and structures the dataset
- Highlights or removes rows based on keywords or employee IDs
- Adds a `Comment` column for feedback
- Saves a well-formatted version to Google Drive
- Sends a confirmation request email to relevant recipients
