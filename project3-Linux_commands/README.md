# Project 3: Linux Backup Script

This script is the final project of the Linux course from the IBM Data Engineering Certificate. It automates the backup process by creating a compressed archive of files modified within the last 24 hours.

### Features:
- Accepts two arguments: the **target directory** to scan and the **destination directory** to store the backup.
- Validates directory inputs.
- Uses timestamping to create unique backup files.
- Moves the archive to the specified destination.

It showcases how shell scripting can be used to streamline data backup tasks.
